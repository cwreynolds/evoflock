//  TODO 20240224 this is an experimental 2.0 version of LazyPredator. It lives
//  inside the evoflock repository. The intent had been to use LazyPredator for
//  evoflock, but it turned out LazyPredator and TexSyn where a bit intertwined.
//  I was loath to make the fixes in LazyPredator's own repository since that
//  would break TexSyn.
//
//  So I am prototyping the changes here. They consist primarily of putting all
//  of LazyPredator into its own namespace, and giving LazyPredator a copy of
//  TexSyn's Utilities.h which it had previously only linked to.
