\begin{abstract}
    This paper describes an automatic method for adjusting or tuning multi-agent motion models. Simulating the motion of bird flocks, human crowds, vehicle traffic, and other multi-agent systems is a widely used computational technique. These simulations model the behavior of a group member (bird, human, or vehicle). The group behaviors (flock, crowd, traffic) emerge from interactions between group members. These models tend to have many numeric control parameters. Although each parameter is understandable in isolation, their interaction can be complex and nonlinear. It can be difficult to know how to adjust which parameters to make a desired change in the group behavior. Changing one aspect of group behavior often causes other aspects to change, leading to a long process of incremental changes. In this work, the desired group behavior is measured with an objective(/fitness/loss) function and optimized with a genetic algorithm.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Simulation models of multi-agent motion are used in many fields, including: animation, games, biology, control of robotic swarms and [...]. Several early models include \textit{boids} \citep{reynolds_flocks_1987} and others [Aoki, Smael, Viksek, ...]. All allow creating simulations of flocks, and other group motions.  They tend to produce motion that most observers would recognize as some sort of flock. This paper will refer to bird flocks, with the assumption that other types of group motion (herds, schools, crowds, traffic) can be portrayed with suitable adjustment of the model.
\par

This paper addresses the issue of \textit{adjusting} or \textit{tuning} multi-agent motion models. For example, modifying a model of bird flocks to instead portray fish schools. Or say, to start from a model of flocking crows and change it to represent a flock of sparrows. Or to take a faithful model of a birds flock in nature, and change it, say for storytelling purposes, to convey a flock of birds that are happy, or angry. Similarly, to take a generic flock model, and fit it to observations of real birds.
\par

A boids-like simulation model usually has a collection of numeric parameters to control its action. (In this work, there are about 20 parameters.) Initially, adjusting the parameters is required, simply to create group motion that looks like flocking. Any sort of modification to a group motion model, such as the examples mentioned above, required further adjustments to the parameters. Each such adjustment requires selecting which parameter(s) to change, whether it should increase or decrease, and by how much. Often more than one parameter needs changing. The difficulty is that the effects of control parameters overlap and interact. Changing one usually requires changing another to compensate. Often, the result is that many of them need to be changed, and the overall behavior of the model gets worse. It can become a frustrating and time-consuming process.
\par

This paper is about automating that adjustment process using metrics of flock quality, and an optimization process. The metrics use multiple objectives. The optimization process is a genetic algorithm.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Since the 1980s various simulation models of bird flocks have been proposed including \textit{boids} \citep{reynolds_flocks_1987} and others (\citet{aoki_simulation_1982}, \citet{cucker_emergent_2007}, \citet{bhattacharya_collective_2010} [[[\textbf{Is this the best citation for Vicsek?}]]]).
\par

Most previous work on automatic tuning for flock models has used reinforcement learning [[[\textbf{cite}]]] as the optimization technique. While this paper was being drafted, a preprint was posted \citep{brambati_learning_2025} which uses reinforcement learning with an objective function very similar to the one used here. Other flock tuning based on reinforcement learn include:
[[[\textbf{cites?}]]].
\par


The approach used here was developed as part of a larger ongoing collaboration investigating new approaches to optimization of multi-agent motion. [[[\textbf{cite Matthew's thesis?}]]]

\subsection{Optimization Method}
\label{subsec:Objective_Function}

...In this work, optimization is used to find simulation parameters for individuals that best fit the group behavior goals... It uses a genetic algorithm, a technique based on concepts from biological evolution, as seen in the natural world. Genetic algorithms were first described by \citet{holland_adaptation_1975}. Evolution was first described by \citet{darwin_origin_1859}.
\par

\subsection{Objective Function}
\label{subsec:Objective_Function}

This work is based on optimizing a set of parameters for a flock (multi-agent motion) model. Optimization procedures are guided by an \textit{objective function}. In many optimization problems, the overall objective is a combination of several, potentially contradictory goals. This is generally called multi-objective optimization. 
\par

To motivate this concept, consider building a bridge over a river. A key criterion is that the bridge is reliable: it will carry the required loads without collapsing. Another criterion is that the cost of building the bridge is minimized. These criteria are directly opposed. A very strong bridge is reliable but costly. A very cheap bridge is unlikely to be reliable. This trade-off is often called \textit{Pareto optimality}. Tuples of such Pareto optimal values form the \textit{Pareto front}, see Figure \ref{fig:Pareto-front}.
\par

    \label{fig:Pareto-front}
\end{figure}

[[[\textbf{to be polished}]]] Other types of multi-objective optimization have less contradictory goals. The multi-agent motion problem seems to fall into this category. Here all that is required is to find parameter sets so that each of the objectives can be well satisfied. [[[\textbf{another figure?}]]]
