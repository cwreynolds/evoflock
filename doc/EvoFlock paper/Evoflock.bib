	abstract = {Randomized search heuristics (RSHs) are known to have a certain robustness to noise. Mathematical analyses trying to quantify rigorously how robust RSHs are to a noisy access to the objective function typically assume that each solution is re-evaluated whenever it is compared to others. This aims at preventing that a single noisy evaluation has a lasting negative effect, but is computationally expensive and requires the user to foresee that noise is present (as in a noise-free setting, one would never re-evaluate solutions). In this work, we conduct the first mathematical runtime analysis of an evolutionary algorithm solving a single-objective noisy problem without re-evaluations. We prove that the \$(1+1)\$ evolutionary algorithm without re-evaluations can optimize the classic LeadingOnes benchmark with up to constant noise rates, in sharp contrast to the version with re-evaluations, where only noise with rates \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} {\textbackslash}log n)\$ can be tolerated. This result suggests that re-evaluations are much less needed than what was previously thought, and that they actually can be highly detrimental. The insights from our mathematical proofs indicate that this similar results are plausible for other classic benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Traditionally the systematic study of animal behaviour using simulations requires the construction of a suitable mathematical model. The construction of such models in most cases requires advanced mathematical skills and exact knowledge of the studied animal's behaviour. Exact knowledge is rarely available. Usually it is available in the form of the observer's linguistic explanations and descriptions of the perceived behaviour. Mathematical models thus require a transition from the linguistic description to a mathematical formula that is seldom straightforward. The substantial increase of the processing power of personal computers has had as a result a notable progress in the field of fuzzy logic. In this paper we present a novel approach to the construction of artificial animals (animats) that is based on fuzzy logic. Our leading hypothesis is, that by omitting the transition from linguistic descriptions to mathematical formulas, ethologists would gain a tool for testing the existing or forming new hypotheses about 'why' and 'how' animals behave the way they do.},

	abstract = {The organized flight of birds is one of the most easily observed, yet challenging to study, phenomena in biology. Birds that fly in organized groups generally do so in one of two fashions: Line formations and Cluster formations. The former groups are typical of large birds such as waterfowl, where birds fly arranged in single lines, often joined together. The scientific questions about these groups usually involve potential adaptive functions, such as why geese fly in a V. Cluster formations are typically made up of large numbers of smaller birds such as pigeons or starlings flying in more irregular arrangements that have a strong three-dimensional character. The groups are defined by synchronized and apparently simultaneous rapid changes in direction. Scientific questions about these groups are usually concerned with mechanism such as how synchrony is achieved. Although field observations about the phenomenon date to the origins of natural history, experimental studies did not begin until the 1970s. Early experimenters and theoreticians were primarily biologists, but more recently aeronautical engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists and, currently, physicists have been attracted to the study of organized flight. Computer modelling has recently generated striking visual representations of organized flight and a number of hypotheses about its functions and mechanisms, but the ability to test these hypotheses lags behind the capacity to generate them. We suggest that a multi disciplinary approach to the phenomenon will be necessary to resolve apparently conflicting current hypotheses.},

Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply “autodiff”, is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names “dynamic computational graphs” and “differentiable programming.” We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms “autodiff”, “automatic differentiation”, and “symbolic differentiation” as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

Schools of fish can move in a rather orderly fashion and then change direction amazingly abruptly. There are a huge number of further examples both from the living and the non-living world for phenomena during which the many interacting, permanently moving units seem to arrive at a common behavioural pattern taking place in a short time. As a paradigm of this type of phenomena we consider the problem of how birds arrive at a decision resulting in their synchronized landing. We introduce a simple model to interpret this process. Collective motion prior to landing is modelled using a simple self-propelled particle (SPP) system with a new kind of boundary condition, while the tendency and the sudden propagation of the intention of landing is introduced through rules analogous to the random field Ising model in an external field. We show that our approach is capable of capturing the most relevant features of collective decision making in a system of units with a variance of individual intentions and being under an increasing level of pressure to switch states. We find that as a function of the few parameters of our model the collective switching from the flying to the landing state is indeed much sharper than the distribution of the individual landing intentions. The transition is accompanied by a number of interesting features discussed in this report.},

Agents integrate positional and orientational information from their closest topological neighbours and learn to balance alignment and attractive interactions by optimizing a local cost function that penalizes both excessive separation and close-range crowding. The resulting Vicsek-like dynamics is robust to algorithmic implementation details and yields cohesive collective motion with high polar order. The optimal policy is dominated by strong aligning interactions when agents are sufficiently close to their neighbours, and a flexible combination of alignment and attraction at larger separations. We further characterize the internal structure and dynamics of the resulting groups using liquid-state metrics and neighbour exchange rates, finding qualitative agreement with empirical observations in starling flocks. These results suggest that flocking may emerge in groups of moving agents as an adaptive response to the biological imperatives of staying together while avoiding collisions.},

All existing models and theories of collective animal behaviour have assumed that each animal interacted with all neighbours within a fixed distance. The STARFLAG data showed something quite different: each bird interacts with a fixed number of neighbours, irrespective of their physical distance. This number is approximately equal to seven. The difference with the assumptions of the models is stark: the data show clearly that the distance within which birds interact is not fixed at all, but rather it depends on the density of the flock. In a packed flock, the seven neighbours you are interacting with are close to you, whereas in a loose, sparse flock they are more distant. Using technical jargon, we may say that birds use a topological definition of the distance, rather than a standard metric definition…

Two unfriendly species that anti-align or even interact non-reciprocally show more complex collective phenomena, ranging from parallel and anti-parallel flocking over runand chase behavior to chiral phases. Whether flocking or any of these collective phenomena can survive in the presence of a large number of species with random non-reciprocal interactions remained elusive so far. As a first step here the extreme case of a Vicsek-like model with fully random nonreciprocal interactions between the individual particles is considered. As soon as the alignment bias is of the same order as the random interactions the ordered flocking phase occurs, but deep within this phase, the random non-reciprocal interactions can still support global chiral and oscillating states in which the collective movement direction rotates or oscillates slowly. For short-range interactions, moreover, even without alignment bias self-organized cliques emerge, in which medium size clusters of particles that have predominantly aligning interactions meet accidentally and stay together for macroscopic times. These results may serve as a starting point for the study of multi-species flocking models with non-random but complex non-reciprocal inter-species interactions.},

	abstract = {Simulation agents are essential for designing and testing systems that interact with humans, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs). These agents serve various purposes, from benchmarking AV performance to stress-testing system limits, but all applications share one key requirement: reliability. To enable sound experimentation, a simulation agent must behave as intended. It should minimize actions that may lead to undesired outcomes, such as collisions, which can distort the signal-to-noise ratio in analyses. As a foundation for reliable sim agents, we propose scaling self-play to thousands of scenarios on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset under semi-realistic limits on human perception and control. Training from scratch on a single GPU, our agents solve almost the full training set within a day. They generalize to unseen test scenes, achieving a 99.8\% goal completion rate with less than 0.8\% combined collision and off-road incidents across 10,000 held-out scenarios. Beyond in-distribution generalization, our agents show partial robustness to out-of-distribution scenes and can be fine-tuned in minutes to reach near-perfect performance in such cases. We open-source the pre-trained agents and integrate them with a batched multi-agent simulator. Demonstrations of agent behaviors can be viewed at https://sites.google.com/view/reliable-sim-agents, and we open-source our agents at https://github.com/Emerge-Lab/gpudrive.},

In biology, computational models have been extensively used to investigate various properties of collective behaviour, such as: transfer of information across the group, benefits of grouping (defence against predation, foraging), group decision-making process, and group behaviour types. The question ‘why,’ however remains largely unanswered. Here the interest goes into which pressures led to the evolution of such behaviour, and evolutionary computational models have already been used to test various biological hypotheses. Most of these models use genetic algorithms to tune the parameters of previously presented non-evolutionary models, but very few attempt to evolve collective behaviour from scratch. Of these last, the successful attempts display clumping or swarming behaviour. Empirical evidence suggests that in fish schools there exist three classes of behaviour; swarming, milling and polarized. In this paper we present a novel, artificial life-like evolutionary model, where individual agents are governed by linguistic fuzzy rule-based systems, which is capable of evolving all three classes of behaviour.},

Accordingly, we have developed a computer-simulated bird flock employing stochastic differential equations which demonstrates realistic "flocking' behavior. The functions employed in our model include attraction to a roost, a nonlinear attraction to flockmates, preservation of flight velocity, and an -dimensional Poison stochastic process. By varying the values of the parameters of the model, we have seen organized flight develop from chaotic milling and an organized flock break up into chaotic flight.},

We examine how the periphery of murmurations remain well bounded and cohesive. We also investigate agitation waves, which occur when a flock is disturbed, developing a plausible model for how they might emerge spontaneously. To understand these behaviors a new model is presented for orientation-based social flocking. Previous methods model inter-bird dynamics by considering the neighborhood around each bird, and introducing forces for avoidance, alignment, and cohesion as three dimensional vectors that alter acceleration. Our method introduces orientation-based social flocking that treats social influences from neighbors more realistically as a desire to turn, indirectly controlling the heading in an aerodynamic model. While our model can be applied to any flocking social bird we simulate flocks of starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, and demonstrate the possibility of orientation waves in the absence of predators. Our model exhibits spherical and ovoidal flock shapes matching observation. Comparisons of our model to Reynolds’ on energy consumption and frequency analysis demonstrates more realistic motions, significantly less energy use in turning, and a plausible mechanism for emergent orientation waves.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence through reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great success on increasingly complex single-agent environments and two-player turn-based games. However, the real-world contains multiple agents, each learning and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other agents, and environments reflecting this degree of complexity remain an open challenge. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that an agent can achieve human-level in a popular 3D multiplayer first-person video game, Quake III Arena Capture the Flag, using only pixels and game points as input. These results were achieved by a novel two-tier optimisation process in which a population of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of parallel matches with agents playing in teams together and against each other on randomly generated environments. Each agent in the population learns its own internal reward signal to complement the sparse delayed reward from winning, and selects actions using a novel temporally hierarchical representation that enables the agent to reason at multiple timescales. During game-play, these agents display human-like behaviours such as navigating, following, and defending based on a rich learned representation that is shown to encode high-level game knowledge. In an extensive tournament-style evaluation the trained agents exceeded the win-rate of strong human players both as teammates and opponents, and proved far stronger than existing state-of-the-art agents. These results demonstrate a significant jump in the capabilities of artificial agents, bringing us closer to the goal of human-level intelligence.},

	abstract = {The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40\% faster convergence to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.},

Also presented is dynamical modeling for the group size distribution as a result of amalgamation and splitting processes of groups. Examples of animal grouping are described in detail. They are insect swarms, zooplankton swarms, fish schools, bird flocks, and mammal herds. The presented mathematical models are compared with data of these animal groupings.},

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

ABM behavior often depends on many model parameters, and the task of exploring a model’s parameter space and discovering the impact of different parameter settings can be difficult and time-consuming. Exhaustively running the model with all combinations of parameter settings is generally infeasible, but judging behavior by varying one parameter at a time risks overlooking complex nonlinear interactions between parameters. Alternatively, we present a case study in computer-aided model exploration, demonstrating how evolutionary search algorithms can be used to probe for several qualitative behaviors (convergence, non-convergence, volatility, and the formation of vee shapes) in two different flocking models. We also introduce a new software tool (BehaviorSearch) for performing parameter search on ABMs created in the NetLogo modeling environment.},

	abstract = {We present a quantitative continuum theory of “flocking\&\#39;\&\#39;: the collective coherent motion of large numbers of self-propelled organisms. In agreement with everyday experience, our model predicts the existence of an “ordered phase\&\#39;\&\#39; of flocks, in which all members of even an arbitrarily large flock move together with the same mean velocity \$〈{\textbackslash}stackrel{\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}rightarrowv〉{\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}n e0.\$ This coherent motion of the flock is an example of spontaneously broken symmetry: no preferred direction for the motion is picked out a priori in the model; rather, each flock is allowed to, and does, spontaneously pick out some completely arbitrary direction to move in. By analyzing our model we can make detailed, quantitative predictions for the long-distance, long-time behavior of this “broken symmetry state.\&\#39;\&\#39; The “Goldstone modes\&\#39;\&\#39; associated with this “spontaneously broken rotational symmetry\&\#39;\&\#39; are fluctuations in the direction of motion of a large part of the flock away from the mean direction of motion of the flock as a whole. These “Goldstone modes\&\#39;\&\#39; mix with modes associated with conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound modes lead to enormous fluctuations of the density of the flock, far larger, at long wavelengths, than those in, e.g., an equilibrium gas. Our model is similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time-dependent Ginsburg-Landau theory for an \$n=d\$ component isotropic ferromagnet. In spatial dimensions \$d\&amp;gt;4,\$ the long-distance behavior is correctly described by a linearized theory, and is equivalent to that of an unusual but nonetheless equilibrium model for spin systems. For \$d\&amp;lt;4,\$ nonlinear fluctuation effects radically alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in \$d=2,\$ where we can calculate the scaling exponents exactly, flocks exhibit a true, long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in \$d=2\$ (the “Mermin-Wagner\&\#39;\&\#39; theorem). We make detailed predictions for various correlation functions that could be measured either in simulations, or by quantitative imaging of real flocks. We also consider an anisotropic model, in which the birds move preferentially in an “easy\&\#39;\&\#39; (e.g., horizontal) plane, and make analogous, but quantitatively different, predictions for that model as well. For this anisotropic model, we obtain exact scaling exponents for all spatial dimensions, including the physically relevant case \$d=3.\$},
